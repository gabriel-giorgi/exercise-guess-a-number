# Guess Game

This is a game where the computer thinks on a 4 digit number(with unique digits) e.g. 1234 or 5279 and you have to guess it. The computer will tell you an answer in the following format: 

2G 2R

That means 2 digits are good(they are in the same position that the hidden number) and 2 are regular( the digits are in the number but they are in the wrong position. If you score 4G you win!
